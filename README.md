## Conclusions

### Key Insights
- **Primary Churn Drivers**: The main causes of churn are **competitor offers** (such as better devices, more data, and more attractive pricing) and **poor customer support** (particularly the attitude of support staff).
- **High-Risk Customer Segments**:
  - Customers in the **48â€“58 age range** exhibit the highest churn rate, despite being a significant portion of the customer base.
  - The **under-30 demographic** also contributes notably to churn, indicating potential dissatisfaction or misalignment with current service offerings.
  - **Heavy data users** (those using more than 10GB) are more likely to churn compared to lighter users, suggesting that these customers may require more specialized or competitive data plans.
- **Geographic Concentration**:  
  States such as **California (75%)**, **Indiana (66.7%)**, and **New Hampshire (62.5%)** display the highest churn rates, indicating potential regional issues that may need targeted intervention.

### Recommendations
- **Competitive Offerings**: To counteract churn driven by competitor offers, introduce **device and data bundles** that are comparable to those of competitors in terms of pricing and value.
- **Targeted Retention Campaigns**: Launch **tailored retention programs** aimed at the **48-58 age group** and **under-30s**, as these segments show higher churn rates. Consider offering promotions or service adjustments that cater to their specific needs.
- **Enhance Customer Support**: Focus on **improving customer support** by providing more training to staff, especially in customer service attitudes, to address dissatisfaction that contributes to churn.
- **Loyalty Plans for Heavy Users**: Implement **high-data loyalty plans** designed specifically for **heavy data users** to ensure they remain satisfied with their service.
- **Regional Focus**: Develop **regional retention strategies** for states with the highest churn rates (**California, Indiana, New Hampshire**), possibly by conducting market research to understand local preferences and competition.
